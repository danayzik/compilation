no need for now:
add exit to main.
differentiate between main and user_main?
Even if a temp is never alive. i need to have a mapping for it. //it's probably fine







Multiple definitions in different scopes, currently works. might be fucked later


Add nil as initial value for class var dec?
Add nil as init value for global var IR?
